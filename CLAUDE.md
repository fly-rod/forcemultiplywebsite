# Force Multiply Consulting - Website Build Guide

## Company Overview

Force Multiply Consulting (FMC) is a hybrid consulting and investment firm that helps organizations innovate through business and technology consulting services centered on AI adoption and modern cloud technologies. What makes Force Multiply different is its dual focus: delivering high-impact consulting for enterprise clients while also acquiring and operating small businesses—creating ownership opportunities for consultants who want to build long-term wealth.

### Mission Statement

In this AI revolution and highly competitive landscape, Force Multiply helps organizations innovate and succeed through business and technical consulting services centered on the adoption of artificial intelligence and modern cloud technologies. At the same time, we invest in our employees by enabling pathways to business acquisition and ownership—giving consultants the opportunity to build long-term wealth, support and operate portfolio companies with the use of AI, and grow as leaders.

### The Flywheel Model

Force Multiply operates on a flywheel effect:
- Consulting revenue funds small-business acquisitions
- Small-business cash flow stabilizes long-term economics
- Employees build equity and career paths beyond hourly billing
- Clients gain access to a consulting team who operate real businesses, not just advise on them

## Brand Identity

### Brand Personality
Clean, confident, and fast—but still approachable. Professional without being corporate, strategic without being stuffy. The kind of brand that shows up prepared, gets to the point, and delivers. No jargon-heavy decks or overengineered frameworks—just people who know the platforms inside and out and help clients get more from what they've already invested in.

- Full color (blue dots on white/light backgrounds)
- White version (for dark backgrounds)
- SVG and PNG formats
